    in the credential - not the name of the credential, the date, the issuer - absolutely nothing. If the signature is invalid 
    you might ask the holder if they had changed anything in it, and if so, to give you the credential as it was 
    when the issuer gave them their copy.

    <div className={styles.note}><img className={styles.infoIcon} src="./icons/info_24_lime.svg"></img>If we can't retrieve the DID document for the DID that signed the 
    credential, or if the public signing key that was used to sign the credential is not in the DID document, then signature verification fails
    because we can't know that the public key was ever 'registered' to that DID. This isn't an issue when using the did:key DID method 
    which doesn't require a separate DID document,
    but is required for did:web and did:webvh methods or any method that stores the DID document remotely.
